Virtual Reality is often referred to as the "empathy machine," as this technology makes it possible to take on the perspective of another person. This could, for example, help to sensitize people to discrimination.
In the VERI project, we are developing a VR scenario to test and evaluate this claim through a user study. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between empathy and different aspects of virtual reality like immersion, presence and interactivity.

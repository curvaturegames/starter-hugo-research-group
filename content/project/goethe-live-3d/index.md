It wasn’t just COVID-19 and the closing of arts- and performance venues that showed us the importance and need of virtual musem offerings. Social VR- and AR technologies allow us to create new concepts for the future of hybrid museums. In this project, which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and spearheaded by the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, we are working on to find out how these offerings have to look like. Together with our other partners Universität Hamburg, Klassik Stiftung Weimar, ArcTron and Concensive we are working on making parts of the exhibition rooms of a museum and selected exhibition objects available as hi-res, true-colour 3D reconstructions. Through the digital copy and XR technologies, visitors can, for example, integreate their family or friends into the on-site experience.

The project aims to convey the content of a course also through the teaching concepts used. Iterative approaches and agile methods are standard in software development nowadays, especially in human-centered development processes, which are based on the fact that feedback from actual users is repeatedly incorporated into the development and that the phases of analysis, design, implementation and evaluation are iteratively passed through again and again.

In this project, an Open Educational Resource (OER) course for the Hamburg Open Online University will be designed that not only addresses these issues, but also conveys them through form and approach.

**Project term:** 08/2021 - 12/2022

**Funding source:** Hamburg Open Online University (HOOU)
